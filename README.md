A project for the course CSC 545: Advanced Database Systems. The premise of the project is to use multiple database structures to create a functioning website, and then compare the usage and implementation of the databases.

Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
To run this application, Apache is required to connect to a localhost. PHPmyAdmin and MongoDB are also required to import the necessary databases for the application. MongoDB requires a php driver and composer. The composer comes with a vendor file that could not be uploaded due to size.

Running the tests

MongoDB
Start up the xampp control panel.

Run the following command mongod in terminal

Connect to your MongoDB server.

Run the following command mongo in other terminal.

localhost/filepath/filename.php should now work.
